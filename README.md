Pinote is a lightweight floating Markdown note app for desktop. Keep multiple notes close at hand for TODOs, code snippets, and temporary ideas without leaving your current workspace.

## Features

- **Markdown Notes** — Edit Markdown in lightweight WYSIWYG windows, with multiple notes open at once.
- **File Sync** — Detect external file changes and reload them when it is safe.
- **Window States** — Set always-on-top, read-only, opacity, position, size, and visibility for each note.
- **Window Shortcuts** — Create notes, restore hidden notes, show all hidden notes, or toggle the current visible set.
- **Custom Controls** — Change keyboard shortcuts, wheel modifiers, and the mouse button used to move windows.
- **Session Restore** — Restore window state, scroll position, and the last visible set after restarting Pinote.
- **History Search** — Find and reopen previous notes by path or content.
- **Appearance** — Choose the interface language and theme, then adjust typography, spacing, and glass effects.
- **Desktop Integration** — Use tray controls, launch at startup, and open files from the command line. Windows also supports File Explorer context menus and Markdown file association.
- **Updates** — Check for updates automatically at startup or manually from Settings.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Default Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt+S` | Restore hidden notes |
| `Alt+Shift+H` | Show all hidden notes |
| `Alt+D` | Show or hide notes |
| `Alt+C` | New note |
| `Alt+A` | Toggle always on top |
| `Alt+R` | Toggle read-only mode |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Toggle theme |
| `Esc` | Hide note |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W` | Close note |

Shortcuts can be changed in Settings. New note, restore hidden notes, show all hidden notes, and show or hide notes are global shortcuts that work from other apps.

## Mouse Interactions

| Default Interaction | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Alt + Wheel` | Resize the window around the pointer |
| `Ctrl + Wheel` | Adjust note opacity |
| Middle click | Toggle always on top |
| Middle drag | Move the note window |
| Right click | Open the note menu |

Wheel modifiers and the mouse button used to move windows can be changed in Settings. When right drag is selected, a right click still opens the note menu.

## CLI

```bash
pinote /path/to/note.md
pinote ./daily.markdown
```

Each `.md` or `.markdown` path opens in its own note window. If the file is already open, Pinote focuses the existing window.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev
pnpm tauri build
```
